<p align="center">If I'm in my Philza skin, I'm open to sitting with Technoblade (PLEASE PLEASE EMERALDDUO I NEED IT), Tommy, Wilbur, Tubbo, Ranboo, Niki, anyone Philza knows basically. I ship emeraldduo in every way possible privately but I don't mind sitting as platonic emeraldduo too! I just think it's at least queerplatonic canonically.</p>
